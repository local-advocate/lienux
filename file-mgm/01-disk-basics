=> Layout:
-  Number of concentric circles (tracks/cylinders)
-  Within each track, there are sectors/blocks (minimumm transfer unit from disk)
-  Stack on top of each other

=> Info for files:
-  Maintain structure to associate file with cylinder and sector
-  Contiguous allocation: simple offset, but file cant grow
-  Linked files: list of all free sectors/blocks. Fd points to first sec/blocl. In each sector keep a pointer to next sector. Disadvantage: Random access have to traverse list. (FAT, MS-DOS)
-  Indexed files: file desciptor points to every sector/block (file descriptor size fixed). Max file size: size of file descriptor table.
