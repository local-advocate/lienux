=> Layers: disk->driver->file system->vfs->sys calls->library->user/application

=> Files:
-  structured or unstructure series of bytes or objects with metadata
-  open file table : how many open files and all metadata for it (removed when no proc uses that file)
-  per proc table  : pointer to open file table, current position, access info

=> File operations:
-  Basic    : create, delete, open, close, read, write, seek, etc.
-  Metadata : links, attributes, owner, protection

=> On create:
-  allocate disk space, create description and location on disk with metadata
-  no file types in unix (left up to program to interpret)
